#Readme
The project has been linked to OpenGL, OBJParser and SOIL library already and can be compiled by Visual Studio 2013.

Task assignment:

Tree.h, Tree.cpp: Dikshita, Justin

Grass.h, Grass.cpp: Madhuri Madhusudan

Don't need to consider the light at first.

the content of Demo.cpp is the same as the first sample, and you can use it to test your result.

If you have LNK1104 error: can't open "SOIL.lib", please reset the linked library path in the following way: project->XXX Properties->linker->general->additional library directory, select the lib folder in the project.
